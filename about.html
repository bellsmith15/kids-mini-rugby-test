                Mini Rugby is coached by the club players who give their time to provide rugby sessions for young children. 
                Making sure that the values that they play by are passed down to the youngest in the club.
                During the game, players will learn how to make tricky decisions which will in turn help them to gain confidence as they learn the rules of the game. 
                Through rugby, children can develop the capability to analyse and deduce general principles in life which can in turn boost their mental, social and physical agility.
